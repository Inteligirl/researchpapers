# Research papers
A collection of research papers and studies that I have completed through the years for college.

## Peer - to - Peer

Write a paper discussing Peer-to-Peer Systems and Grid Systems. Give examples and include images of the systems used for the paper. This paper was focused on the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). Written November 2019.

## Thoughts
This was a pretty fun exercise to complete overall. I enjoyed incorporating the various elements required by the instructor and spent some time learning about how to use jquerry.
